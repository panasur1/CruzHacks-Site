            <h2>About Unity for Hunger</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Unity for Hunger! We are a team of students on a mission to create positive change in our community. Our idea began in 2024 when a group of passionate high school students attending a hackathon in Santa Cruz decided to organize and make an impact. Our goal is to connect restaurants in Santa Cruz with homeless individuals, providing a platform for these establishments to donate their leftover food to those in need. Through our website, we aim to reduce food waste, bridge the gap between local restaurants and the less fortunate, and contribute to the global fight against hunger. We are looking to make a difference and build a more compassionate society.</p>
